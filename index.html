                <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American breed, creating a strain that responds welll to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95 of Mexico's wheat.</li>

Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way can meet the demand, as we run out arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
